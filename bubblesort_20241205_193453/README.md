# Bubble Sort Implementation

This implementation was generated by Claude AI.

## Explanation

Here's a Python implementation of the bubble sort algorithm:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    
    return arr
```

Explanation:
1. The `bubble_sort` function takes an array `arr` as input.
2. We initialize a variable `n` to store the length of the array.
3. We start an outer loop that iterates `n - 1` times. Each iteration represents a pass through the array.
4. Within the outer loop, we start an inner loop that iterates from the first element to the second-to-last element in the unsorted portion of the array (`n - i - 1`).
5. Inside the inner loop, we compare adjacent elements. If the current element is greater than the next element, we swap them.
6. After each pass, the largest element in the unsorted portion of the array "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end of the array.
7. We repeat steps 4-6 for each pass until the entire array is sorted.
8. Finally, we return the sorted array.

The bubble sort algorithm repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.

Example usage:
```python
# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Unsorted array:", arr)

sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```

Output:
```
Unsorted array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
Sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

In this example, we have an unsorted array `[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]`. We pass this array to the `bubble_sort` function, which applies the bubble sort algorithm to sort the array in ascending order. The sorted array `[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]` is then printed.
